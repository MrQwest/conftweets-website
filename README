#Conftweets website

This is the code repo for the [conftweets.com](http://conftweets.com) website. I wanted to host it somewhere so I could edit as & when.

The actual conftweets code is available [here](https://github.com/MrQwest/conftweets)] on github. It's currently in PHP but I have plans to re-write it in JS or Ruby. Feel free to fork & do your own thing :)
